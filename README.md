# Meteorites

In this project I explored the meteorites open data set available from NASA's open data portal. I made changes - adding additional columns - to the data in excel before importing into R. I used the plotly and ggplot libraries to create visualisations. 

A blog about this project can be found @ www.brandendunbar.com

This work is apart of a series of visualisations in astrobiology that I elected to do during my M. DataSci @ Monash University.
